#Empty Leap Project
##Description
This project mostly serves as a blank leap project with useful addons already implemented so I can easily get to work on any new leap projects I want to start on.  Right now I have some simple code written to make a 3D object track the user's hand.  This code is fairly basic and can easily be modified, removed, or expanded upon.
